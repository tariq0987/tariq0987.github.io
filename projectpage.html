            In my first year of the course "Introduction to Programming," I embarked on an exciting journey into the world of coding. 
            I learned the fundamental principles of Python and applied their newfound knowledge to create a basic calculator program. 
            Through hands-on practice, they mastered key concepts like variables, functions, and conditional statements, enabling them to design a functional calculator that could perform basic arithmetic operations. 
            This project marked the beginning of their programming odyssey, laying a solid foundation for their future endeavors in the realm of computer science.

            The second project I did in python was the big group project. 
            We were a team of four to five, and I learned so much from my group members. 
            They helped me become more fluent in Python and helped me understand each and everything we did in the project.
